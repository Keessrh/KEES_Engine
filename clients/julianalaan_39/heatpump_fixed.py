To modify the `heatpump.py` file so that it correctly processes telemetry and sets states according to your rules (e.g., state 5 for `price < 0.06` â‚¬/kWh and `opwek > 1000`), you need to update the `process_data` function to include this logic. Here is how you can adjust the code:

```python
import json

data = {
    "energy_state_input_holding": 7,
    "opwek": 0.0,
    "price": 0.05,
    "sdm120_watt": 0.0,
    "water_inlet_temp": 0.0,
    "water_outlet_temp": 0.0,
    "current_flow_rate": 0.0,
    "outdoor_air_temp": 0.0,
    "compressor_status": 0,
    "dhw_heating_status": 0,
    "dhw_target_temp": 50.0,
    "target_temp_circuit1": 30.0,
    "cop": 0.0,
    "cop_24h": 0.0,
    "compressor_rpm": 0.0
}

def get_data():
    return data.copy()

def process_data(topic, payload):
    global data
    payload_dict = json.loads(payload)

    if "price" in payload_dict:
        data["price"] = float(payload_dict["price"])
    
    if "opwek" in payload_dict:
        data["opwek"] = float(payload_dict["opwek"])
    
    # Check conditions to set energy_state_input_holding
    if data["price"] < 0.06 and data["opwek"] > 1000:
        data["energy_state_input_holding"] = 5
    else:
        # You might have other rules for setting the state, or keep it as it is
        data["energy_state_input_holding"] = 3  # Default or any other rule you have

def run_heatpump():
    print("Running heatpump logic")
    # Other logic can go here as required.
    return data["energy_state_input_holding"]
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Global Data Update**: We're updating the `data` dictionary with the incoming telemetry for fields like `price` and `opwek`.

2. **Conditional Logic**: Added a check to set `energy_state_input_holding` to `5` if the `price` is less than `0.06` and `opwek` is greater than `1000`.

3. **Default/Alternative Logic**: If conditions aren't met, a default state is set (e.g., `3`), or other logic can be applied depending on your additional rules.

Ensure this script updates the `energy_state_input_holding` accurately in accordance with your specific operational rules. Adjust the alternative/default logic (`3` in this example) based on your application's required behavior.
